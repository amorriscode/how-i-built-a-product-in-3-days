# How I Built a Product in 3 Days (Thanks to RedwoodJS)

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This year during [Y Combinator's Build Sprint](https://blog.ycombinator.com/announcing-yc-build-sprint-and-20-equity-free-grants/), I built [Postage](https://postage.care). I built it fast. But how? Using [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com) of course!

Redwood makes the JAMstack developer experience a breeze. If you haven't heard of it, you're missing out.

It was nice to see you at [React Vancouver September 2020](https://reactvancouver.com)!
